# Hiya!

My name is Stephanie, or Steph if you prefer, and I am making my way further and further in to the world of IT and the cloud. I have done a lot of studying to be here! All that study has paid off though. I was recently hired for iRobot, I have passed my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate and completed an in depth project to solidify all that knowledge. You can find my resume project, which includes my blog set up as well, in my repos.
