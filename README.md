# Hiya!

My name is Stephanie, or Steph if you prefer, and I am somewhat new to the world of IT and the cloud. I have done a lot of studying to be here!
All that study has paid off though. I have passed my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate and completed a fairly in depth project to solidify all that knowledge. 
You can find my resume project, which includes my blog set up, as one of my repos. Unless it is before July 31st, 2020, in which case I am 
keeping things hidden till others have had a chance to complete the challenge before the deadline. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to land a job. Any tips, challenges or advice is welcome.
